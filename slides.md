^ It's lovely to see you all again from up here. I've had a transformative experience since I saw you last. I'm here to talk about that. Transformative experiences are always fun, aren't they? Here's the source of mine.

^ If you were paying attention to node, you remember this fight. For anybody with any experience in technical writing, it's a no-brainer. Correct style demands not dragging gender in where it doesn't need to be. But for the node core team, it was a big deal. And for a legion of trolls on Hacker News, it was an outrage.

# [fit] So I looked up
# [fit] from what I was doing.
# [fit] I looked around.
# [fit] I saw a lot of nothing.

---

# [fit] What didn't I see?
# [fit] Women.

^ No women on node core, of course. Not a lot of women in open source. Estimates are hard to come by here, but it falls even further behind the percentage in our industry to start with. And no wonder, with idiots like the ones trolling that thread.

# Community panel at Node Summit 2014

Late invitation because there were few women on the schedule.
@dshaw gave me a mic.
Brave man.

^ Last year I was on a panel at Node Summit talking about the node community. I was a last-minute invitation, prompted because the organizer had received some pressure about having no women on his agenda.

---

# [fit] the Node.js project
# [fit] should recruit
# [fit] women.

^ So I went on a mini-rant about how if you wanted to see women in open source, you had to stop wringing your hands about it.

^ Nothing happened. After that panel I did some thinking. At New Years I made a resolution: I was going to spend time in 2014 helping other women engineers any way I could.

# [fit] How did I become
# [fit] a unicorn?

^ First step: I asked myself how I'd done it.

---

# [fit] stubborn &
# [fit] oblivious

^ I'm stubborn and oblivious. My friend Laura Lemay described her success as being due to these two awesome traits, and I think mine is also. They're awesome!

---

# [fit] Don't do this.


---

# [fit] Determined
# [fit] & empathetic.

^ Here are some better adjectives.

---

oblivious reaction: what guy trying to drive me off? I didn't even notice.
stubborn reaction: screw you; I'm going to do what I want

determined reaction: screw you
empathetic reaction: who else has that guy driven off? I'll see if I can do something to help them.

# Priming.

^ Touch on the research that says that reminding people of bad stereotypes about their group makes them perform worse: expectations influence behavior. Priming is a real thing.

---

This means that if you talk to me about writing software, I'm going to give you relentlessly positive messages.

# STEM degrees

Not all STEM fields are alike:

* 43.1% of degrees in math & statistics go to women
* 18.2% in computer sciences

^ The percentage number is now tracking engineering as a whole & not math, as it did in my day. Math numbers are up!

# Wait.
# What?
# WAT.

It got worse instead of better since my day.
A lot worse.

^ Want to be around more women & be even better prepared for writing software? Get a degree in math, not CS. Seriously. Math is the secret weapon of great programmers.

---

* Degrees in math are holding steady.
* Math is about 1% of total degrees awarded
* CS is about 4%

If you don't want women in tech, I don't want you in tech. If you're part of the problem here, on purpose, I want you out.

We like to praise ourselves for inventing the future & being on the forefront of this & that. So why are we so regressive? Why is Google's engineering staff 17% women if it's so forward-thinking?

Put up or shut up, men in tech! Either help the future or get out of the way.



If you are a hiring manager, put your hand up.  I'm talking to you now. We're going to talk about how to go from "oh I wish I could do this but it's so haaaaard" to actually doing it. Ready?

I was reading about attempts to make conference lineups more diverse. The organizers of all-male lineups always say, "but it's so haaaaard!" These people only solve easy problems, not hard ones, I guess. But here's the thing: conference organizers who set out to get more diverse lineups all end up saying things like this: "It turned out to be easier than we thought once we actually tried."

[slides that are examples with quotes]

Hiring is going to be like this too. Not easy, but easier.

Step one: Say publically that a diverse workforce matters to you. Say it on every job posting. Say it in all the email you use to communicate with candidates. Signal congruently to everybody that this matters.

Step two: enlist the women who are in your company now to interview every candidate. This is an amazing weeder: it signals to your women candidates that they'll be safe, and it drives off the asshats who would have trouble working with women.

Step three: Act like it matters.  I'm going to ask you to do something that feels risky if you've been making conservative, safe, boring choices, the same choices you've been making all along. But this is where you show the world that this issue matters to you.

- Hire a qualified woman for that next job, or a minority candidate, even though there's another one who looks like they already know everything.

- Remember that the candidate is *presenting themselves* as more junior than they are. The brash young guy who looks more senior probably *looks* that way but isn't-- culture has taught him to put himself forward. The women applying have been taught to understate their abilities.

You can't fix that part of the culture overnight, but you *can* teach yourself to remember it when you're evaluating candidates.

Ask yourself what this candidate can learn, and what you see this person being in a couple of years. Remember you're probably going to get somebody who's a lot better than you thought.

This won't always work out. Hiring doesn't always work out. But hey, you can always console yourself in this Machievellian way that you at least got that candidate cheaply.


# what my fellow women can do

The hiring managers can stand down. Now I'm going to talk to my fellow women in engineering. Wave at me please, so I can feel less unicorn-y. Hi!

I just signed you up for extra work interviewing people. Sorry about that, but I think it'll pay off long-term.

What I'm most worried about with you all is keeping you around.

Keep on keeping on.


Talent myth.

You can learn it. Of course you can do that-- write a file system, write a mobile app, become a CSS expert, learn a new programming language. It's just a matter of work.
