^ It's lovely to see you all again from up here. I've had a transformative experience since I saw you last. I'm here to talk about that. Transformative experiences are always fun, aren't they? Here's the source of mine.

^ If you were paying attention to node, you remember this fight. For anybody with any experience in technical writing, it's a no-brainer. Correct style demands not dragging gender in where it doesn't need to be. But for the node core team, it was a big deal. And for a legion of trolls on Hacker News, it was an outrage.

---

# [fit] So I looked up
# [fit] from what I was doing.
# [fit] I looked around.
# [fit] I saw a lot of nothing.

---

# [fit] What didn't I see?
# [fit] Women.

^ No women on node core, of course. Not a lot of women in open source. Estimates are hard to come by here, but it falls even further behind the percentage in our industry to start with. And no wonder, with idiots like the ones trolling that thread.

# [fit] Yay. I'm a unicorn.

^ I'm a middle-aged woman who is a software engineer who contributes to open-source projects. Wow, that image doesn't fit me. Let's try this.

---

# [fit] More like this.

^ That's more like it. Frankly, I don't like being a unicorn. Let me tell you a little story about how much I don't like it.

# Community panel at Node Summit 2014

Late invitation because there were few women on the schedule.
@dshaw gave me a mic.
Brave man.

^ Last year I was on a panel at Node Summit talking about the node community. I was a last-minute invitation, prompted because the organizer had received some pressure about having no women on his agenda.

---

# [fit] the Node.js project
# [fit] should recruit
# [fit] women.

^ So I went on a mini-rant about how if you wanted to see women in open source, you had to stop wringing your hands about it. They aren't volunteering themselves and you probably aren't going to fix the social reasons why they aren't. If node wants women involved, it's going to have to recruit them. The leadership, the Node Core team, is going to have to recruit minorities. Put up or shut up.

---

![original](assets/can-o-crickets.jpg)

^ Nothing happened. Okay. Now what?

---

# [fit] Let's figure this out.

^ So I did some thinking about women in node, women in software, women around me. I decided I was going to have to put up or shut up myself.

---

# [fit] How did I become
# [fit] a unicorn?

^ First step: I asked myself how I'd done it.

---

# [fit] stubborn &
# [fit] oblivious

^ Laura Lemay's phrase; totally awesome traits

---

# [fit] "Girls don't program computers!"

^ Let's try out stubborn & oblivious, shall we?

---

## [fit] Stubborn:

### [fit] Screw you; I'm going to do what I want.

---

## [fit] Oblivious:

## [fit] Sorry didn't notice.
## [fit] Too busy writing this module.

^ See? Totally awesome! End result is I write software!

---

# [fit] Not actually a good idea.

## [fit] Not everybody wants to be
## [fit] that thick-skinned.

^ In fact, I'll go one step further.

---

# [fit] People shouldn't
# [fit] have to be that
# [fit] thick-skinned.

^ Let's try some better adjectives. Ready?

---

# [fit] Determined
# [fit] & empathetic.

^ Aaaah. Lots better, huh? Much more positive. Let's look at how that plays out.

---

# [fit] Girls don't program computers!

---

## [fit] Determined:

## [fit] I'm going to do what I want.

^ Subtle change there. Do you see it?

---

## [fit] Empathetic:

## [fit] Who else has that guy
## [fit] driven off?

^ That guy has probably made somebody else's life miserable. I'll see if I can do something to help them.

# the future!
## uh...

^ Friends, I thought the future would be better than the past. We like to praise ourselves for inventing the future & being on the forefront of this & that. So why are we so regressive? Why is Google's engineering staff 17% women if it's so forward-thinking?


It's worse than it was, though. What does this have to do with you? Yes you, oh person in the audience. I am talking to you. Painful truth time.

---

# [fit] how you act
# [fit] is what your
# [fit] values are

^ How you talk tells me nothing but what you think you should be, or how you think you should look to other people. How you act tells me what you value, really and truly.

---

# [fit] RIP Mortimer Snerd
# [fit] He only worked on
# [fit] easy problems

^ But it's hard! You tell me. I know! But nobody's going to give you credit for doing easy things.

---

# [fit] Do you truly value
# [fit] diversity
# [fit] in our profession?

^ Look at what you've done. If you are a hiring manager, put your hand up.  I'm talking to you now.

---

![left, filtered](assets/ifttt_team_photo_cropped.jpg)

## [fit] if your team looks like this
## [fit] it's because you
## [fit] didn't try.

^ It doesn't matter what your values are. You didn't act on them.

---

![](assets/Golden_tabby_and_white_kitten_n03.jpg)

^ Stop. Adorable kitten. Remember that I love you, and I that I know this feels hard, and that you're wondering how to juggle your responsibilities with your values.

---

## [fit] This is the npm team.
## [fit] @izs acted on his values.

^ My challenge paid off a couple months later. And guess what: he got a kick-ass team.

---

# [fit] It's easier than you fear

^ The first thing you have to do is *try*. Remember: you're going to be determined & empathetic. Now we're going to talk about how.

---

# [fit] Congruence:

# [fit] harmony & agreement
# [fit] all signals aligning

^ Give examples: yes/no + yes/yes.

---

> We are not a typical early stage startup. We believe that working sensible hours and taking care of ourselves and our loved ones is the best way to ensure long-term productivity. We care deeply about making tech a more inclusive and diverse place.

-- yes, please apply

^ How to signal congruently that you want to hire diversely.

---

> We're terrible at work-life balance. Although work is pretty much your life, we do our absolute best to make sure that work is as awesome as possible so you at least enjoy each and every day here.

-- run away! run away!

^ How to signal to women you don't want them.

---

# It's easier than you fear.

> There is a lot more work involved to get women to submit to a tech conference. However, the work pays off in spades because the submissions from women (for us) ranked significantly higher on average than men’s submissions.

[Beating the Odds — How We got 25% Women Speakers for JSConf EU 2012](http://2012.jsconf.eu/2012/09/17/beating-the-odds-how-we-got-25-percent-women-speakers.html)

^ Still need help?

---
If you don't want women in tech, I don't want you in tech. If you're part of the problem here, on purpose, I want you out.

We like to praise ourselves for inventing the future & being on the forefront of this & that. So why are we so regressive? Why is Google's engineering staff 17% women if it's so forward-thinking?

Put up or shut up, men in tech! Either help the future or get out of the way.



If you are a hiring manager, put your hand up.  I'm talking to you now. We're going to talk about how to go from "oh I wish I could do this but it's so haaaaard" to actually doing it. Ready?

I was reading about attempts to make conference lineups more diverse. The organizers of all-male lineups always say, "but it's so haaaaard!" These people only solve easy problems, not hard ones, I guess. But here's the thing: conference organizers who set out to get more diverse lineups all end up saying things like this: "It turned out to be easier than we thought once we actually tried."

[slides that are examples with quotes]

Hiring is going to be like this too. Not easy, but easier.

Step one: Say publically that a diverse workforce matters to you. Say it on every job posting. Say it in all the email you use to communicate with candidates. Signal congruently to everybody that this matters.

Step two: enlist the women who are in your company now to interview every candidate. This is an amazing weeder: it signals to your women candidates that they'll be safe, and it drives off the asshats who would have trouble working with women.

Step three: Act like it matters.  I'm going to ask you to do something that feels risky if you've been making conservative, safe, boring choices, the same choices you've been making all along. But this is where you show the world that this issue matters to you.

- Hire a qualified woman for that next job, or a minority candidate, even though there's another one who looks like they already know everything.

- Remember that the candidate is *presenting themselves* as more junior than they are. The brash young guy who looks more senior probably *looks* that way but isn't-- culture has taught him to put himself forward. The women applying have been taught to understate their abilities.

You can't fix that part of the culture overnight, but you *can* teach yourself to remember it when you're evaluating candidates.

Ask yourself what this candidate can learn, and what you see this person being in a couple of years. Remember you're probably going to get somebody who's a lot better than you thought.

This won't always work out. Hiring doesn't always work out. But hey, you can always console yourself in this Machievellian way that you at least got that candidate cheaply.


# what my fellow women can do

The hiring managers can stand down. Now I'm going to talk to my fellow women in engineering. Wave at me please, so I can feel less unicorn-y. Hi!

I just signed you up for extra work interviewing people. Sorry about that, but I think it'll pay off long-term.

What I'm most worried about with you all is keeping you around.

Keep on keeping on.


Talent myth.

You can learn it. Of course you can do that-- write a file system, write a mobile app, become a CSS expert, learn a new programming language. It's just a matter of work.

# [fit] my resolution:
# [fit] 2014 is the year
# [fit] I help other women.

^ At New Years I made a resolution: I was going to spend time in 2014 helping other women engineers any way I could.

# or like, maybe

(icebreaker ship with unicorn horn)

# [fit] What about you?

^ That's me. That's my decision.
