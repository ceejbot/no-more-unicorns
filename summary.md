# I don't want to be a unicorn

Last year I learned I was a unicorn, a sparkly magical rare beast. Why am I a unicorn? I'm a middle-aged woman who writes software for a living, and what's more, works on open source. There aren't many people like me: *half* of the women who enter programming careers drop out after a decade or so, and there aren't a lot of women who even *start* writing software.

This is, I believe, awful, because it's pretty wonderful being me. I get to program computers for a living, which is the most fun I can imagine having while being paid. And what's more, my work jet-assists *other* people who write software, which is deeply personally satifying. I don't want to be special. I want more people like me around!

How did it happen that I became a unicorn? Why are women dropping out of this profession? Why do we care? How can we, the Javascript community, stop creating unicorns?
